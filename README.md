# cloud lab stuff

Lab for playing with things ""cloud native"".  None of this is meant to be
useful or make sense to anyone other than myself.

* Commits mean backup not milestones.
* Stuff that is relevant and mature will most likely be moved out to own repo.
* Passwords and keys are sandbox / disposable.

## ongoing stuff

* `ckad.manifests` - manifests used while revising for CKAD
* `leapspin` - spin up 1+ leap 15.2 clones
* `k8s-6node` - 3m + 3w ubuntu 20.04 kubadm k8s cluster
